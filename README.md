This app is a quick and dirty solution to [this code challenge](http://cloud.jchook.com/0g361n3p3b10). It isn't meant to be used in the wild.


## Get It Started

Clone the repo and open it up in your terminal:

- `yarn install` will grab the dependencies
- `yarn start` will serve the app in your browser
- and `yarn test` will run the app's unit tests

If `yarn` isn't your package manager of choice, just replace it with `npm` and these commands will still work. See the docs for [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) (linked above) for more info on these and the rest of the scripts available to you.
